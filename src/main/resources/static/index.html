    <h1>Welcome to Sakila Spring Boot starter</h1>

    <p>This is where you are supposed to build your app :-) This index.html is in <em>src/mian/resources/static</em>.</p>

    <h2>Browsing and modifying JPA entities</h2>

    <a href="/explorer/">Browse and modify entities</a>

    <p>In case you started this app from the src/test/java/**/TestDemoApplciation, like you should have, you can though
        usethe <a href="/explorer/">entity explorer view</a> (configured to be available during testing) to browse the
        db (and to make tiny changes).</p>

    <p>Note, that the entity explorere uses Vaadin Flow. In case you plan to use Vaadin, be sure to change dependencies
        and configs from the test side to the main scope/sources!.</p>

    <p>Alternatively you can find out your Docker container running the Sakila DB and open a direct
        DB connection to the server.</p>
